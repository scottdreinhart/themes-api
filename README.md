## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v24+ (pin via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) — see `.nvmrc`)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v10+

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server (auto-restart on file changes)
pnpm dev

# Start production server (no file watching)
pnpm start

# Build for production (compiles TypeScript to dist/)
pnpm build

# Run compiled production build
pnpm preview
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Individual tools
pnpm lint           # ESLint — check for issues
pnpm lint:fix       # ESLint — auto-fix issues
pnpm format         # Prettier — format all source files
pnpm format:check   # Prettier — check formatting without writing
pnpm typecheck      # TypeScript type check (tsc --noEmit)

# Chains
pnpm check          # lint + format:check + typecheck in one pass (quality gate)
pnpm fix            # lint:fix + format in one pass (auto-fix everything)
pnpm validate       # check + build — full pre-push validation
```

### Testing

```bash
pnpm test           # Run all tests once
pnpm test:watch     # Watch mode — re-run on file changes
pnpm test:coverage  # Run with V8 coverage report
```

### Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t themes-api .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 themes-api
```

### Cleanup & Maintenance

```bash
pnpm clean          # wipe dist/ build output
pnpm clean:node     # delete node_modules only
pnpm clean:all      # nuclear — dist/ + node_modules/
pnpm reinstall      # clean:all + pnpm install
```

## Architecture

This project enforces seven complementary design principles:

1. **CLEAN Architecture** (Layer Separation)
   - `domain/` layer: Pure types, errors, constants, schemas (zero framework dependencies)
   - `app/` layer: Fastify instance builder, use-case services
   - `infra/` layer: External adapters (database, cache, third-party APIs)
   - `routes/` layer: HTTP route handlers (thin — delegates to app/domain)
   - **Benefit**: Domain logic is testable, reusable, and framework-independent

2. **SOLID Principles** (Code-Level Design)
   - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
   - **Benefit**: Code is maintainable, testable, and resistant to side effects

3. **DRY Principle** (No Duplication)
   - Shared schemas, constants, and error types eliminate duplication
   - **Benefit**: Changes propagate consistently; less code to maintain

4. **Import Boundary Enforcement** (`eslint-plugin-boundaries`)
   - `domain/` → may only import from `domain/` (zero framework deps)
   - `app/` → may import `domain/` + `app/` (never `infra/` or `routes/`)
   - `infra/` → may import `domain/`, `app/`, and `infra/`
   - `routes/` → may import `domain/`, `app/`, and `routes/`
   - **Benefit**: CLEAN layer violations are caught at lint time, not at code review

5. **Path Aliases** (`@/domain`, `@/app`, `@/infra`, `@/routes`)
   - Configured in `tsconfig.json` (`paths`) and `vitest.config.ts` (`resolve.alias`)
   - Eliminates fragile `../../` relative imports across layers
   - **Benefit**: Imports are self-documenting and resilient to file moves

6. **Barrel Exports** (`index.ts` per directory)
   - Each layer exposes a single public API via its barrel file
   - Internal module structure can change without breaking consumers
   - **Benefit**: Explicit public APIs; refactoring internals doesn't cascade import changes

7. **Schema-First Validation** (Zod + OpenAPI)
   - All inputs validated with Zod schemas in the domain layer
   - Fastify route schemas auto-generate OpenAPI docs via `@fastify/swagger`
   - **Benefit**: Single source of truth for validation, serialization, and documentation

## Remaining Work

### Core Functionality

- [ ] **Domain model implementation** — define entities, value objects, and business rules for theme packs, catalog items, asset manifests, download tokens, purchase records, and install states
- [ ] **Database integration** — connect to PostgreSQL/SQLite via Drizzle ORM or Prisma
- [ ] **CRUD route scaffolding** — RESTful endpoints for all domain entities
- [ ] **Authentication** — JWT or API key verification middleware
- [ ] **Authorization** — role-based access control for admin vs. client operations

### Code Quality & Testing

- [ ] **Unit tests** — domain functions and use-case services
- [ ] **Integration tests** — route handlers with database fixtures
- [ ] **E2E tests** — full request lifecycle with Supertest or Fastify inject

### DevOps & Deployment

- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline** — GitHub Actions workflow for lint → test → build → deploy
- [ ] **Database migrations** — version-controlled schema changes
- [ ] **Environment configs** — staging, production, and preview environments
- [ ] **Monitoring** — health-check alerts, error tracking, APM integration

## Future Improvements

- [ ] **CDN integration** — serve theme assets from a global CDN (CloudFront / Cloudflare R2) with signed URLs for access control
- [ ] **Image optimization pipeline** — auto-generate preview thumbnails, WebP variants, and responsive sizes on theme upload
- [ ] **Theme preview sandbox** — API endpoint that renders a live preview of a theme applied to a sample game board
- [ ] **Incremental asset sync** — delta downloads so game clients only fetch changed files when a theme updates
- [ ] **User-generated themes** — allow players to upload custom themes with moderation queue and approval workflow
- [ ] **Theme ratings & reviews** — endpoints for users to rate/review themes with aggregated scores on catalog listings
- [ ] **Seasonal collections** — auto-curate time-limited theme bundles (holiday, event-based) with scheduled publish/unpublish
- [ ] **Cross-game compatibility matrix** — track which themes work with which games and auto-filter the catalog per game
- [ ] **Analytics endpoints** — report most-downloaded, highest-rated, and trending themes for storefront personalization
- [ ] **Webhook notifications** — notify game clients when a purchased theme receives an update

| **[Shut the Box](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/shut-the-box)** | Roll dice, flip numbered tiles to match the total; lowest remaining sum wins | Similar — grid UI + dice logic |
| **[Mancala (Kalah)](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/mancala)** | Two-row pit-and-stones capture game; simple rules, satisfying chain moves | Slightly higher — seed-sowing animation |
| **[Connect Four](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/connect-four)** | Drop discs into a 7×6 grid; first to four in a row wins | Similar — larger grid, same win-check pattern |
| **[Simon Says](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/simon-says)** | Repeat a growing sequence of colors/sounds; memory challenge | Similar — leverages existing Web Audio API |
| **[Lights Out](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/lights-out)** | Toggle a 5×5 grid of lights; goal is to turn them all off | Similar — grid + toggle logic |
| **[Nim](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/nim)** | Players take turns removing objects from piles; last to take loses | Simpler — minimal UI, pure strategy |
| **[Hangman](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/hangman)** | Guess letters to reveal a hidden word before the stick figure completes | Similar — alphabet grid + SVG drawing |
| **[Memory / Concentration](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/memory-game)** | Flip cards to find matching pairs on a grid | Similar — grid + flip animation |
| **[2048](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/2048)** | Slide numbered tiles on a 4×4 grid; merge matching tiles to reach 2048 | Slightly higher — swipe input + merge logic |

| **[Battleship](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/battleship)** | Place ships on a grid, take turns guessing opponent locations | Moderately higher — two-board UI + ship placement |
| **[Snake](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/snake)** | Steer a growing snake to eat food without hitting walls or itself | Different — real-time game loop instead of turn-based |
| **[Monchola](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/monchola)** | Traditional dice/board race game with capture mechanics | Similar — dice roll + board path + capture rules |
| **[Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/rock-paper-scissors)** | Best-of-N rounds against the CPU with hand animations | Simpler — minimal state, animation-focused |
| **[Minesweeper](https://github.com/scottdreinhart/minesweeper)** | Reveal cells on a minefield grid without detonating hidden mines | Moderately higher — flood-fill reveal + flag logic |
